## Hazard Systems Research Group

The **Hazard Systems Research Group (HazSys)** conducts research on the use of
**artificial intelligence for disaster forecasting, modelling, and response**.

We develop methods to anticipate and analyse **interacting natural hazards**,
with a focus on **AI-enabled forecasting**, **early warning systems**, and
**decision support for disaster risk reduction**. Our work combines machine
learning with system-level modelling to better understand cascading impacts,
uncertainty, and operational constraints.

HazSys is based at **King’s College London**, spanning the **King’s Institute for
Artificial Intelligence** and the **Department of Geography**, and works at the
interface of AI, Earth systems, and disaster risk.

### Research themes
- AI-enabled multi-hazard forecasting and early warning  
- Modelling of cascading and compound disasters  
- Uncertainty-aware prediction and evaluation  
- Decision support for disaster response and adaptation  

### Leadership
The group is led by **Lorenzo Nava**, AI+ Academic Senior Fellow at King’s College London.
