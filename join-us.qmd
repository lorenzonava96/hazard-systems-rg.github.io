We welcome collaborators and applicants interested in **AI-enabled multi-hazard forecasting,
early warning systems, and decision support**.

Our work combines machine learning, physical modelling, and uncertainty analysis to support
risk-informed decisions for natural hazards.

## Research themes

- Multi-hazard and cascading event modelling
- Machine learning for hazard detection and forecasting
- Uncertainty-aware prediction and evaluation
- End-to-end warning pipelines and decision support
- Open tools, reproducible science, and real-world impact

## Opportunities

### PhD / MSc students
Applicants with a strong quantitative background (e.g. machine learning, statistics, physics,
engineering, or geoscience) and an interest in hazards and resilience.

### Postdoctoral researchers
Researchers with evidence of independent work, strong writing, and a clear research agenda
aligned with the group’s themes.

We are happy to support applications to competitive postdoctoral fellowships, including:

- Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships
- Newton International Fellowships
- Royal Society or UKRI-funded schemes (where applicable)

### Research software / engineering
Researchers with experience in machine learning tooling, data pipelines, and reproducible research.
